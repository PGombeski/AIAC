Welcome to **AIAC**, a sandbox for exploring how generative AI thinks, creates, and sometimes surprises us.  
This repo is part research notebook, part playground - blending **prompt engineering**, **vibecoding**, **model testing**, and hands-on experiments.

## ðŸŒŸ What You'll Find Here

This isnâ€™t just another AI repo full of API calls.  
Itâ€™s where we **ask fundamental questions about AI capabilities, run structured tests, and share lessons learned** about:

- **Prompt Engineering** â†’ Designing prompts that are clear, targeted, and sometimes delightfully fun.
- **Vibecoding** â†’ Turning ideas into movement.
- **GenAI Best Practices** â†’ Whatâ€™s working now, and what weâ€™ve learned the hard way.
- **Evaluation & Testing** â†’ From reproducibility checks to bias detection to temperature experiments.
- **Applied Creativity** â†’ Turning abstract AI capabilities into useful (and infrequently really useful) outputs.
